                            <h3>Why video games Matter to Me</h3>
                            <p>Video games have become more than just a hobby for me it's a way of seeing the world differently. When I first picked up a controler was during early childhood playing the halo on xbox with my dad. I was immediately captivated by how a single moment could be the differnce between wining and losing.</p>
                           
                            <p>This quickly became more then just an escape from reality, but a way to connect with friends that were not physicaly close to me. I moved around a lot in my childhood but video games have always been a way to bond over completing challenges and solving problems with my best friends, no matter how far we were apart.</p>
                           
                            <p>Video games have taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of being present in the moment. These skills have translated directly into my academic work, helping me approach problems with a more analytical and creative mindset.</p>

                            <h3>My Journey with online markets</h3>
                            <p>My passion with online markets started as a curiosity and has evolved into one of my greatest passions. What began with simple micro tansactions for video games has grown into a deep understanding of multiple micro economys both inside and outside of video games.</p>
                           
                            <p>One of my proudest moments was buying some in game items in a game called rust and re-selling them for double the value later on. Seeing my investment double and actually put more money in my pocket incredibly rewarding, especially when I told my skeptical parents of my success. This experience showed me the power of online markets to create wealth in unorthodox ways.</p>
                           
                            <p>I love the analytical aspect of investing. Each vertual stock is subject to rapid change, and each new investment is a creative challenge. The collaborative nature of analysing these vertual items is fun to think about with my friends. Often the price of an in game item is determind by how cool it looks, the cooler an item the better resale potential. These discusions are more then talking about video games for me, its market research with my most trusted aquantences.</p>

                            <h3>Exploring the Great Outdoors</h3>
                            <p>Living in Duluth has given me access to some of the most beautiful natural landscapes in Minnesota. Hiking and outdoor activities have become essential for maintaining balance in my life, especially during the demanding academic semesters.</p>
                            
                            <p>One of my favorite trails is the Superior Hiking Trail, which offers breathtaking views of Lake Superior and the surrounding forests. I've learned that spending time in nature helps me think more clearly and approach challenges with a fresh perspective. It's during these quiet moments on the trail that I often come up with my best ideas for projects and solutions to complex problems.</p>
                            
                            <p>These outdoor experiences have also taught me resilience and determination. Whether it's pushing through a difficult hike or facing a challenging coding problem, I've learned that persistence and the right mindset can help overcome any obstacle.</p>
